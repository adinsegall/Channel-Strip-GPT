# Channel Strip GPT
Channel Strip GPT is an AI-powered Channel Strip. A plugin that so far, includes EQ, Compression, Reverb, a HPF and LPF as well as controls for pre and post-gain.  The plugin has a text box that allows the user to describe the sound they desire. The user input is then analysed by a language model and values for each plugin parameter are assigned based on the user input. I am still in the process of implementing the AI portion of the channel strip.
